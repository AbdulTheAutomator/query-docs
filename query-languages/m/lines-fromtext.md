# Lines.FromText

## Syntax

<pre>
Lines.FromText(<b>text</b> as text, optional <b>quoteStyle</b> as nullable number, optional <b>includeLineSeparators</b> as nullable logical) as list
</pre>
  
## About  
Converts a text value to a list of text values split at lines breaks. If includeLineSeparators is true, then the line break characters are included in the text. <div> <ul> <li><code>QuoteStyle.None:</code> (default) No quoting behavior is needed.</li> <li><code>QuoteStyle.Csv:</code> Quoting is as per Csv. A double quote character is used to demarcate such regions, and a pair of double quote characters is used to indicate a single double quote character within such a region. </li> </ul> </div>
