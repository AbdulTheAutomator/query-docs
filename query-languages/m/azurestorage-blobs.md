Each row contains a link to the container blobs. <code>options</code> may be specified to control the following options: <ul> <li><code>BlockSize</code> : The number of bytes to read before waiting on the data consumer. The default value is 4 MB.</li> <li><code>RequestSize</code> : The number of bytes to try to read in a single HTTP request to the server. The default value is 4 MB.</li> <li><code>ConcurrentRequests</code> : The ConcurrentRequests option supports faster download of data by specifying the number of requests to be made in parallel, at the cost of memory utilization. The memory required is (ConcurrentRequest * RequestSize). The default value is 16.</li> </ul>
